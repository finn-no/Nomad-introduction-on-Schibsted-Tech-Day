# Cluster scheduler!

* abstracts away machines and location of applications
* declare what you want to run
* where and how to run is handled for you

Note:

It abstracts away machines and the location of applications, and enables users to declare what they want to run. And then the scheduler takes those declarations and decides where they should run and how to run them.
