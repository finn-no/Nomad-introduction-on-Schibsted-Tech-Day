# Why Nomad?

## One binary!

Note:

That is correct; it is extremely simple to get started with Nomad. Just start the Nomad binary on each machine in the cluster, link them together and you're good to go. It does not need any external services for coordination or storage, like Kubernetes needs etcd and Mesos needs Zookeeper. But of course you can use more tools for extending the usefulness of Nomad, like Consul for service discovery or Vault for managing secrets.
